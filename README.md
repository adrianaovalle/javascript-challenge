# Java Script Challenge

## Description
This code will create a table dynamically based upon a dataset of all of the eye-witness reports of Extraterrestrial Sites. The dataset is also searcheable depending on user's  criteria.

## Level 1
* Create a basic HTML web page 
* Using the UFO dataset  in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, code appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.
* Columns are created for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment at the very least.
* Use  date form in the HTML document and JavaScript code will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.

## Level 2
* Using multiple input tags, JavaScript code filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns: date/time, city, state, country, shape.
The resulting site for level 2 code can be seen at:
